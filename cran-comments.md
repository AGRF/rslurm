This is a minor update to the package to fix a previous error found by CRAN
when checking package on r-devel on Mac OS X.

## Tested on

win-builder (devel and release)
Ubuntu 12.04 with R 3.3 (on travis-ci)
OS X with R 3.3 (local machine)

## R CMD check results

1 NOTE (for some versions)
    Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ‘parallel’
     All declared Imports should be used. 
     
This note occurs because the `parallel::mcMap` function is called in the batch
scripts generated by this package's functions (from the template located at inst/templates/slurm\_run\_R.txt), rather than in the package's R code itself.
